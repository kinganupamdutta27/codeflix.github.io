Here, you can find information and links for upcoming and ongoing technical and coding competitions, as well as previous competitions and hackathons. To build this site, we have utilized the Kontests API to fetch contest data and the Pixabay API for image data.
CodeFlix is a dynamic web application that aims to bring together coding and development enthusiasts by aggregating data from various APIs and providing a centralized platform to explore and participate in coding contests, hackathons, and other development-related events. This project leverages the power of APIs to collect up-to-date information about contests from different sources, making it a one-stop solution for developers to discover, track, and engage in coding challenges.
